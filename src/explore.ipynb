(it's as big as what the old lemmings game was in the 1990s) it's so addictive and fun to play whilst having a good feel about it. for me beats angry birds 2 game very easily and will no doubt remain so for the near future. the only flaw in it is loads of adds and becomes so slow when connected to the internet, but thankfully, the in game adds can be binned for a small fee but it also plays fine offline.   \n",
